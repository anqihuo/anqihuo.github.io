Hello everyone. My name is **Anqi Huo**. I am an oboist.:musical_note: Welcome to my website.

I graduated from the Orchestral Faculty at [Wuhan Conservatory of Music](http://lxs.whcm.edu.cn/) in 2021. I have studied under the guidance of Prof. Juan Lin and Yi Cao (Konzertexsamen in HMDK Stuttgart).

I am currently looking for a Master of Music opportunity in Germany. Welcome to follow my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@anqihuo2055) to learn more about my performances.
