Hello everyone. My name is **Yilong Zang**. Welcome to my website.

I am a final grade master student at [National Engineering Research Center For Multimedia Software](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?lang=2) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I am supervised by Prof. [Ruimin Hu](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?a=show&catid=69&id=71&lang=2) and Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/) (co-advisor). My research interests are fraud detection, graph neural network, and social network.
